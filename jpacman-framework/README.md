jpacman-framework
=================

Pacman-like game used for teaching software testing.

Parts of the code are well tested, whereas others are left untested intentionally.
As a student in software testing, you can extend the test suite, or use the framework to build extensions in a test-driven way.
As a teacher, you can use the framework to create your own testing exercises.

I have developed and am using this code at a software testing course at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. Teachers interested in seeing the exercises I use there are invited to contact me. 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this framework, please do not hesitate to contact me.
